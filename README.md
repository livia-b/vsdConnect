This library implements a client for the REST API of the virtualskeletondatabase (www.virtualskeleton.ch). It supports authentication, general queries, and specific requests such as image upload/download, object linking and right management. Examples are provided in the examples directory. Please use 'demo.virtualskeleton.ch' for testing purposes.

## Problems
* The server response is very slow if you have 50+ folders. VSD-connect makes a request to the server for each folder. Therefore, I will be slow if you have a lot of folders and use the folder methods. You should then use the getRequest function and create your APIFolder object locally.

## Get Started

from vsdConnect import connectVSD

api = connectVSD.VSDConnecter()
obj = api.getObject(21)
print(obj.selfUrl, obj.name)
